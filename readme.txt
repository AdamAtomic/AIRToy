DESCRIPTION

AIRToy is a very lightweight "project generator" command-line script
for creating ActionScript and Adobe AIR SDK projects. It is primarily
designed to make it much easier to generate new ActionScript projects
without an IDE. Sample usage:

> sh AIRToy/inflate.sh MyNewGame

This creates a new empty AS3 template project, similar to the ones
generated by Flash Builder or Flash Develop, and launches it in ADL,
the Adobe AIR debug launcher, providing a handy trace console.

AIRToy also has support for template projects and files, making it
easy to create more complex projects. For example:

> sh AIRToy/inflate.sh MyNewFlixelGame -flixel

Generates a simple "hello world" Flixel game, complete with state file.
Currently AIRToy only supports two templates out of the box:

-tweenlite
-flixel

AIRToy is NOT meant to be a full IDE replacement, just a way to streamline
rapid prototyping in ActionScript 3 and AIR.



INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION

AIRToy is very easy to set up and install. First, download and install the
Adobe AIR SDK ( http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html ) wherever
you want.

Then download and install the latest AIRToy release wherever you want.
I like to keep it in my ActionScript project folder, with the rest
of my games and stuff, but it should work from anywhere.

Finally, in the AIRToy folder, duplicate config.sh and call the new file "custom.sh".
Edit "custom.sh" and update the various critical file paths (like filling in the AIR SDK
install path, the path of your ActionScript project folder, default app width/height, etc).

That's it! You should be able to create a command-line ActionScript project now,
using AIRToy's main script "inflate.sh" from the OS X Terminal, like so:

MyComputer:MyProjects user$ sh AIRToy/inflate.sh MyNewGame



PLANS

AIRToy is very, very early in development, but these are the features I
am most excited about adding in the future:
- a nape (physics engine) template
- ADT packaging for desktop
- Windows support (switch to python?)
- ADT packaging for Android
