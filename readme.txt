DESCRIPTION

AIRToy is a very lightweight "project generator" command-line script
for creating ActionScript and Adobe AIR SDK projects. It is primarily
designed to make it much easier to generate new ActionScript projects
without an IDE. Sample usage:

> AIRToy/inflate MyNewGame

This creates a new empty AS3 template project, similar to the ones
generated by Flash Builder or Flash Develop, and launches it in ADL,
the Adobe AIR debug launcher, providing a handy trace console.

AIRToy also has support for template projects and files, making it
easy to create more complex projects. For example:

> AIRToy/inflate MyNewFlixelGame -flixel

Generates a simple "hello world" Flixel game, complete with state file.
Currently AIRToy only supports two templates out of the box:

-tweenlite
-flixel

AIRToy is NOT meant to be a full IDE replacement, just a way to streamline
rapid prototyping in ActionScript 3 and AIR.



INSTALLATION and CONFIGURATION

AIRToy is very easy to set up and install. First, download and install the
Adobe AIR SDK ( http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html ) wherever
you want. (NOTE: AIRToy also works fine with the Flex 4.6 SDK)

Then download and install the latest AIRToy release wherever you want.
I like to keep it in my ActionScript project folder, with the rest
of my games and stuff, but it should work from anywhere.

Finally, in the AIRToy folder, duplicate "config.cfg" and call the new file
"custom.cfg". Edit "custom.cfg" and update the various critical file paths
(like filling in the AIR SDK install path, the path of your ActionScript
project folder, default app width/height, etc).

That's it! You should be able to create a command-line ActionScript project now,
using AIRToy's "inflate" script from the OS X Terminal, like so:

> AIRToy/inflate MyNewGame



MXMLC IS TOO SLOW, HELP, WHY IS EVERYTHING AWFUL

While the AIR SDK is in many regards the best, most modern ActionScript SDK
from Adobe, it's actually notably lacking some crucial utilities for
command-line development. Primarily, the mxmlc compiler is *crazy slow* by
default. A lot of developers prefer to use fcsh, the "flash compiler shell"
utility, instead. Unfortunately this tool ONLY comes with the Flex 4.6 SDK
(AIR v3.1), not the AIR SDK (v3.7), for reasons I do not understand. Fcsh is
also an interactive shell, so to use it effectively from the command-line you
need a third party utility like fcshctl:

http://hasseg.org/blog/post/194/fcshctl-the-flex-compiler-shell-controller/

...in order to actually be able to use it. AIRToy is totally fine with that!
First, download the latest version of the Flex SDK from Adobe. Then, copy the
fcshctl shell script from that website into your Flex SDK's /bin folder.
Finally, in your custom.cfg file, set the SDK parameter to your Flex SDK
install path, set AIR_VERSION="3.1", and set COMPILER="bin/fcshctl mxmlc".
This speeds up compile times immensely, especially on projects with external
source paths and libraries.



PLANS

AIRToy is very, very early in development, but these are the features I
am most excited about adding in the future:
- a nape (physics engine) template
- ADT packaging for desktop
- Windows support (switch to python?)
- ADT packaging for Android
